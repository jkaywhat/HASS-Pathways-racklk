# HassPathwaysMockUp
A mock-up page for HASS Pathways Open Source Project

This was originally the static mockup website planned to become the new layout for an open source project I was working on at school. After reviewing with the project lead, it was decided that the original layout would stay due to reasons independent of the project. Now, this website is jsut hosted to showcase a bit of my skillset, with the possibility of being updated when I have time.

Thanks for checking this website out!
